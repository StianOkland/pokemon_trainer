# Pokemon Trainer in Angular

// TODO: add heroku link<br/>
A Pokemon trainer app created with Angular, where the user can catch and release Pokemons. The trainer page displays the current user's caugh Pokemon, along with the option to delete each one of them. The catalogue page displays all Pokemons, indicates whether a Pokemon has already been caught, and provides an option to catch the Pokemon if not.<br/>
This app stores user data in a deployment of [Noroff Assignment API](https://github.com/dewald-els/noroff-assignment-api), and obtains its Pokemon data from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).
<br/>
This project is deployed [here]().
